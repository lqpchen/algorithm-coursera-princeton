## Summary:

This repo includes all algorithms and data structures I implemented from scratch as well as the assignments (that passed thourough test cases from the grader and averaged over 99/100).

## Progress:

Done part1 and currently doing part2.

## Review:

Good introductory level algorithm course typlically taken by lower undergrads. Seems to have covered all necessary fundamental algorithms every programmer or data science practitionors should know well. The implementation is based on Java and language specifics in Java are also explained throughout the course, including concepts like Interface, Comparable, Comparator, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, and so forth. Demonstrates useful techniques like recurssion that makes code much simpler especially for tree based structures and graphs. Assignments demonstrates how to apply the algorithms to real application problems.
